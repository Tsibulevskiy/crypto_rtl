        <p>Incorporated in Ontario, Canada with Company Reg. No. ------
          PRIVACY POLICY (as at 2 June 2019)
        </p>
        <h5>Background to this Privacy Policy</h5>
        <p>SHAMS Invest  (we/us/our) takes the issue of the privacy of your Personal Data seriously.</p>
        <p>Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('Data Subject') and an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.</p>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to your permitted access to this website and/or the use of the SHAMS App as regards to any Personal Data that may be collected from you or provided by you during such access or as a result of your access to our website or as a result of your using the SHAMS App.</p>
        <p>This privacy policy has been published to provide to you a clear and concise outline of how and when Personal Data is collected, stored and/or used by us.</p>
        <p><strong>IF YOU USE ANY SERVICE PROVIDED BY US OR YOU PROVIDE VOLUNTARILY ANY PERSONAL DATA TO US THEN YOU SPECIFICALLY REPRESENT TO US THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND CONSENTED TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA.</strong></p>
        <p>From time to time, we may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy without specific notice to you. We strongly recommend that you check this document on a regular basis to ensure that you understand the obligations detailed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy will be accessible by you either through our website or through the SHAMS App.</p>
        <h5>Personal Information You Provide Us</h5>
        <p>We do not generally collect Personal Data about you except when you provide that information voluntarily and in accordance with our various application forms that are available on this web site or through the SHAMS App. Once you have provided Personal Data it will only be used for purposes of registration so that we can forward to you the information that you have requested via the SHAMS App or through this website. In other words, all collected Personal Data about you will be used solely for the purpose to which you have consented. Such information will not be transferred to other parties unless you are fully informed prior to such transference and you have agreed to such transference, unless we are required by law to transfer the information to an authorized organization. In particular you acknowledge that for the purposes of “Know You Customer” obligations imposed upon us in order to comply with any Anti-money Laundering and Counter Terrorism laws you permit us to share you Personal Data with any organization that we engage to meet such obligations.</p>
        <p>The above only relates to your Personal Data and does not relate to any aggregated or other information that may be developed or created internally by us, provided this other information cannot later be used or combined with other information to identify you in any way whatsoever and therefore maintains our privacy commitment to you.</p>
        <p>The information we may collect which we collectively call Personal Data is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="row align-items-center">

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices see below.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h5>

            <img src="./img/svg/Group16.svg" alt="">
            <p class="col-11">Advertisers may let us know you installed our Mobile App so we can determine whether we showed you an ad for it.</p>
